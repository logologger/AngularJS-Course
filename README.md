<h2>This part covers the AngularJS Course design for Front End Development</h2>

<i>It is Assumed that person taking up this course having atleast medium knowledge of Javascript</i>

<b>Day 1:</b> <p>Today we will cover the basics of AngularJS. Why was it needed. How was it different from other frameworks.We will discuss about MVC Architecture .How AngularJS implements it and eases the things for us.What is a Single Page Application.WE will explore the basic advantage of dependency injection in AngularJS and how it changing the way to develop front End Applications</p>

<b>Day 2:</b><p>Today we will start coding our first AngularJS app.We will disucss about how angularJS divides our application into modules . We will see how modules can be broken down into each set of components. Whereas each component is made of controller ,Views, Services , Directives...It will be just a basic disussion about each like controller , Services ...WE will discuss the lifecycle of an AngularJS Applications</p>


<b>Day 3:</b><p>We will continue the above discussion and will see how we can create a  simple application using the above concept . We will implement a basic backbone for our AngularJS application. We will disucc using expressions in AngularJS and how they get evaluated . We will built a sample application using ng-model that will bind the controller to the view and this will explore the concept of $scope and this in AngularJS . </p>

<b>Day 4:</b><p>We will discuss the concept of using functions in controller for performing various complex operations and returning data from the operation to the view . We will explore the in-built directives in AngularJS like ng-repeat that can be help us to iterate through the array data. Other notable in-built directives includes ng-if, ng-hide,ng-show,ng-class,ng-cloak,ng-include and others</p>

<b>Day 5:</b><p>Now we have covered a notable part of our AngularJS controller. We will dive into Services,factories ,constants . How they can be used to pass the data between various controllers in AngularJS. We will explore the difference between factories and services in AngularJS. Which one to use and when.We will design one sample service that will fetch the data from the API using $http.</p>


<b>Day 6:</b><p>Now we have covered Services,factories in AngularJS . We will explore how we can design out own filters in AngularJS and pipe our data into filters and get the desired output.We will design our own form and see how AngularJS provide features to deal with featuresl like ng-dirty,ng-pristine and other for various form validation. We will discuss some events provided by AngularJS for dealing with like click,dbl click etc.</p>

<b>Day 7:</b><p>We will see how we can use routers in AngularJS and how we can use to route to different parts of the application. This way we will see how our application design should be done and how various parts of the application should be placed.We will explore UI Routers in AngularJS and how it offers much benefits to the modern day web application</p>


<b>Day 8:</b><p>We will explore the custom Directive in AngularJS and how can we manipulate DOM using directives . How AngularJS provides us a directive based approach.What are the various lifecycle of a directives.How we can create re-usable directives and how we can turn diretives into components. We can cover some small unit testing framework like karma or Mocha or Jasmine for performing Unit Testing in AngularJS </p>


<b>Day 9:</b><p>We will cover a small project walk through in AngularJS and how we are using various techs as discussed above. We will explore Angular2 and how it is transforming the AngularJS world and how it is different from AngularJS and why it was needed</p>
